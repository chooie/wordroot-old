WordRoot
========
An educational application that teaches the meaning of words and their roots.

Getting Started
---------------
Before building the application, these tools must be installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v5.5.0/) (v5.5.0)
- [MySQL](http://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/) (v5.7.11)

Import the SQL file in the root of this project into MySQL. This will build the database schema and seed some example data.

To test the application is functioning correctly, run the 'jake' shell or batch script whilst within the project root directory. i.e. `./jake.sh`.

To run the application and test manually, run the 'jake' script with the 'run' command. i.e. `./jake.sh run`.

A list of tasks may be viewed by passing the '-T' flag to the 'jake' script: `./jake.sh -T`.

Seed Project
------------
The application was seeded by [chooie-automatopia](https://github.com/chooie/chooie-automatopia).
